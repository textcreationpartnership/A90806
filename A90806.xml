            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>THe honourable Court of Parliament for the avoiding of bloud, directed the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> Lord Generall, by himſelfe and others, in ſome ſafe and honourable way to cauſe to be delivered an humble Petition, wherein they deſire nothing from His Majeſty, but that he would returne in peace to his Parliament, &amp; by their faithful coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel and advice compoſe the diſtempers and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſions abounding in his Kingdome, as he is bound to doe: They therein profeſſing in the ſight of God, which is the ſtrongeſt obligation and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance that any Chriſtian, and the moſt ſolemne publique faith, which any ſuch ſtate as a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can give, that they would receive him with all honour, yeeld him all true obedience and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, and faithfully endeavour to defend his perſon and eſtate from all danger, and to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt of their power to eſtabliſh to him and to his people all the bleſſings of a glorious and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py raigne.</p>
               <p>For the delivery of which Petition his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence hath twice ſent to the King, humbly deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a ſafe conduct for thoſe that ſhould be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed therein; but his Majeſty refuſed to give any ſuch ſafe conduct, or to receive this humble and dutifull Petition, by any addreſſe from the E. of Eſſex, ſaying that if Juſtice had been done, the Gentleman which brought the ſecond Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
<pb facs="tcp:111349:4"/>could not expect his liberty.</p>
               <p>By all which, and many other evidences and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements, they are fully convinced in their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and beliefe, that the Kings counſels and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions are ſo engaged to the Popiſh party, for the ſuppreſſion and extirpation of the true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that all hopes of peace and protection are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, and that it is fully intended to give ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the Papiſts by alteration of Religion, and to the Cavaliers and other Souldiers, by expoſing the wealth of the good Subjects, eſpecially of this City of <hi>London,</hi> to be ſackt, plundered, and ſpoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by them.</p>
               <p>And that for the better effecting hereof, great numbers of Papiſts have in ſhew conformed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Proteſtant Religion, by comming to Church, receiving the Sacraments, and taking the oathes of Allegeance &amp; Supremacie, which ſome of their own Prieſts have encouraged them to do, by maintaining that they might doe all thoſe things, and yet continue good Catholikes: Under which colour his Majeſty did at firſt begin to ſtrengthen himſelfe, thoſe of that Religion being weak, and unable to endure the envie and diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent which the arming of the Papiſts would Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure in the Kingdome, and therefore endeavoured to keep off all jealouſies and ſuſpicions by many fearfull oathes and imprecations, concerning his purpoſe of maintaining the Proteſtant Religion, and the Laws of the Kingdome, cauſing ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt Papiſts to be diſcharged out of his Armie, and none to be received that would not endure the
<pb facs="tcp:111349:5"/>Teſt of comming to Church, receiving the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and taking the oathes of Allegiance.</p>
               <p>That his Majeſty being now grown ſtronger, and able (as he conceives) to make good his own ends by Arms, his confidence in the Papiſts doth more clearly appeare: perſons impriſoned for Prieſts and Jeſuites have been releaſed out of the Gaole of <hi>Lancaſter;</hi> profeſt Papiſts have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited to riſe and take up Arms; Commiſſions un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der His Majeſties Authority have been granted to many of them for places of command in this war, with power to raiſe me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
